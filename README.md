# Collaboration
If you want to contribute new languages / hardware support / platforms or if you've got a code tweak, feel free to fork / submit a pull request and contribute!

# Inspiration
This projecttakes inspiration from [Just Call Me Koko](https://github.com/justcallmekoko) and his work on the [XboxOneRapidFire](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/XboxOneRapidFire/blob/master/rapid_fire_arduino_xbox_one_s.ino) repo. At the time of creating this project, I've got no C++ experience, so I started a new project to utilise MicroPython on a spare Wemos D1 Mini I had.

# This README is a work in process... check back later for more!
